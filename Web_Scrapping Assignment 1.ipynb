If the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence, then our mission in publishing this new edition of Twain\\'s works will be more emphatically fulfilled.\"[50] Another scholar, Thomas Wortham, criticized the changes, saying the new edition \"doesn\\'t challenge children to ask, \\'Why would a child like Huck use such reprehensible language?\\'\"[51]\\n'], [\"See guidelines for writing about novels.
